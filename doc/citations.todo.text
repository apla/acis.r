# ACIS Citations TO DO List

2006-10-02 23:57

This plan does not include any work on ReDIF parser, on RAS
maintenance or fixing bugs in the existing ACIS code.  It
did include one work item to do on the AMF parser, but it
has been done already.


### Test and fix

   - remove debuggings from:

       - ACIS::Citations::Input

   - remove matrix consistency checks in SimMatrix

   - clear all XXX marks
