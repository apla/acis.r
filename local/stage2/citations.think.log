Citations in ACIS


2006-01-13 16:32 

The incoming citations data have to be processed and saved into a database.
Not only it has to be written to the database, but the database has to be
brought in sync with the data.  This means that some records will have to be
deleted from it, if they disappear from the original files.

(Two ways here: use RePEc-Index and ARDB or put all citations data into a
temporary table and then replace the old table with the new one.  That's A
QUESTION.)

Incoming data will probably look like this:

    <amf ...>
      <text ref="ref">
        <reference>
          <literal> text of citation </literal>
        </reference>
        <reference>
          <literal> another citation </literal>
        </reference>
        ...
      </text>

      <text>
        ....
      </text>

      ...
    </amf>


And we put it into a table of the following structure:

  document id | normalized searchable citation string | full original citation text

QUESTION: we need to define the table structure and for that we have to have a
reasonable maximum length of the normalized searchable citation string field.
(On the other hand, is this really a problem?  Because we will only search by
name variations and the author names are always in the beginning of the
citation string, aren't they?  So it is not a problem, it may even be used as
a feature. ;-) )

Later, we use this table to find the relevant citations when a user enters a
citations profile and starts a search.

Offline citation search will be run in a way similar to ARPU (via bin/arpm) or
will be joined with ARPU.  [That's a QUESTION.]  It will execute a search for
the personal name variations in the citations table, filter out the already
found or refused and will store the rest in the suggestions table.

Online citation search will run like the background automatic research search
and there will be a status screen, which will show that the process is going
on and the results are not ready yet.


As we read data citations from the suggestions table, we can reconstruct the
refering object's data (with the help of the resources table): title, authors,
type, details link.

After that stage we have a pool of citations and a pool of documents and we
need to establish the matches between the items of this pool.  A citation can
point to one document, not to several.  But many citations can point to a
single document.  Citations also may be brought by mistake, they can point to
some other person.  We will give the user an option to filter it out.  (How?)




When we are about to present the citations to the user for verification and
identification, we need a string similarity algorithm.  With it we will
identify, which documents are the most interesting ones in terms of citations.
Probably, the ones which have most citations are also the most valuable to the
author himself.

When the documents are ordered by their "interestingness", we can verify and
identify the citations.

Here I suggest to do both things together, without a separate verification,
even though it was planned originally.

We go through the interesting documents, one by one, starting with the most
interesting one.  Right after the document's description on the page we list
citations that we believe may be relevant to it.  Below that we list citations
which were identified as pointing to this document earlier.  Both lists will
be clearly separated.  Each item in the first list will have a checkbox to
confirm that this citation really points to this document.  The checkbox will
probably be checked by default, but it may depend on the level of similarity
found.

Then there also will be a checkbox to deny (refuse) a citation.  Unchecked by
default.  If the user checks it and sends the form, we will put that citation
into the refused list, and will not show it on the following document screens.

For each step we will have to find the most interesting document given the set
of current citations for that moment.  Let us measure similarity by numbers.
Then, we will build a matrix of similarity levels found between every
suggested citation and every document in the research profile.  After each
step we will throw away the citation rows of the identified and the refused
citations.  Then we will sum up the citations' similarity numbers for each
document and will choose the one with the largest number.

* But the similarity level number will have to be zero for neglegible
  similarity, or it will influence the "interstingness" sorting in an
  undesired way. (2006-01-19 16:46)

For each citation we will show the original citation string, the title, the
authors, type of the referencing work and a link to its full details.

* Do we need all these details at this stage?  We could show the original
  citation string only and then only show full details on the identified
  citations screen. (2006-02-02 21:18)

Then there may be some citations left after this with no document that is
similar to them.  Those we may show and verify.  By verify we mean: ask the
user, Are these citations of your works or not?

Given that there may be lots of citations (who knows?) we will have to make
a paging mechanism for them on this screen.

On every stage of the process we want to show the user how many more citations
are there for her to process.

Several citations may come from a single document, so it would make sense to
group them.

CITATIONS DATA PROCESSING QUESTIONS

Checksum of all the citations of a document?  How to process if a citation is
removed from a document?  How will the citations profile get cleared of such
citations?

All the development again has to be divided into levels, but not exactly in
the same way as it was in stage 3.  There must be the most basic level first,
which will be functional on itself.  It must be workable on its own, it must
be sufficient.  Then the improvements.

For a sufficient level some interactions or design may be rough, some advanced
features may be unavailable.  

This is not reflected in the current plan.

Question: Should we display the identified citations to the general public on
the personal profile pages, that ACIS generates?

If we search for citations in the background, we can also do
citation-to-document matching in the background.  And dump the results to a
table.
