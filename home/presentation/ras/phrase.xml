     <h3>Cool.</h3>

     <p>Miracles only happen in fairy tales.  Reality is harsh,
     humorless and dumb.  You have to run around like a fool to live a
     decent life.  Noone will do that for you.</p>

     <p>No, we will not read you a lecture on an active lifestyle.
     Just keep yourself away from my house, and I'll not bother you.
     Friends are not who you drink beer with on friday night.  Friends
     will not promise you great blue sky, unless they are gods and
     make up the weather by themselves.</p>

   <h2>On adding your works</h2>
   
   <p>To add a work to your research profile, it must already be in our
   documents database.  You cannot add other works yourself.  We do
   not accept individual document submissions. However, you can submit your work to <a href='http://mpra.repec.org/' target='NEW'>MPRA</a>, that would integrate it in RePEc.</p>
