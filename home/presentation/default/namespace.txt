The templates use the following namespaces and prefixes

xsl   http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform
exsl  http://exslt.org/common
acis  http://acis.openlib.org
date  http://exslt.org/dates-and-times
html  http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml
      http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml

All templates should be set to use the xhtml namespace as the default,
except the email templates and the export templates.

The elements in the acis namespace include

acis:c
acis:check
acis:comment
acis:content
acis:d
acis:fields
acis:field
acis:desc
acis:error
acis:form
acis:hint
acis:message
acis:messages
acis:name
acis:onsubmit
acis:page
acis:par
acis:phrase
acis:phrasing
acis:root
acis:script-onload
acis:step
acis:tab
acis:ten

When such an element is outside a namespace, or in the default xhtml
namespace, it is surely an error, it needs to be found and fixed.

Some elements may be in the acis namespace or in the xhtml namespace,
or in the null namespace. These are the fieldset element

acis:input
acis:textarea
acis:select

There is a great deal of confusion because these elements
go through very complicated treatment.


The elements in the acis namespace should include, the following

html:a
html:input

since they carry attributes not allowed with xhtml.  But I have not
converted them since this is a relatively cumbersome operation.

The data handled down by ACIS itself is in the null namespace.
