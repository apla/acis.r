   we have collected over time: shows years and monthes for
   which we have events data and links to pages about it.

 - /adm/events/...

   /adm/events

   Preference options: 

   - how many atomic events to load per page

   - how many sessions to load per page

   - show sessions in open view or closed view upon page
     load

   Show current settings and reset them at user's will, all
   in JavaScript.

 - ACIS can now run under Matt Sergeant's fine PPerl (persistent perl)
   http://search.cpan.org/dist/PPerl/

 - new main.conf, [ACIS] section parameters: cgi-perl-wrapper and
   cgi-perl-wrapper-restart (for PPerl).

 - No longer using CGI.pm monster module.  Using CGI::Minimal instead.
   CGI::Cookie, which is a part of the CGI.pm distribution, is still required

2006-01-27 17:42 (ACIS-1.4.20-20060127b)

 - PPerl: instead of the parameters mentioned yesterday:
   cgi-pperl-binary and cgi-pperl-reinit

 - documentation updated
